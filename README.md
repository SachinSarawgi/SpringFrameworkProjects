# Spring Core Module Based Sample Project

## What is Spring?

    Spring is a lightweight Inversion of Control and aspect oriented container framework.
    J2EE application can be benefite from Spring Framework interms of Simplicity, loose coupling and testability.
    Provides comprehensive infrastructure for developing J2EE application, where Spring handles the infrastructure and developers focus on application development.
  
## Features of Spring:
  - Lightweight: Spring is lightweight in terms of size and transparency. Its lightweight feature helps in reducing complexity of the code. A light framework has less startup time.
  - Inversion of Control: Spring container is lightweight container that contains Spring beans and manages their life cycle. The core component of the Spring Framework provides an implementation of IoC, IoC is architectural pattern which tells that dependecy injection is done by external entity rathen then creating the dependencies by the component itself.
  - Aspect-oriented Programming: Isolates supporting function from main program business logic. Core functionality of the application is unaware of additional requirements. AOP in Spring Framework provide declarative aspects such as transaction, security, logging.
  - JDBC Exception Handlng: The JDBC abstraction layer of the Spring Framework provides an exception hierarchy. It shortens the error handling strategy in JDBC. This is one of the areas where Spring really helps in reducing the amount of boilerplate code we need to write in the exception handling.
